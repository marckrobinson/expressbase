# expressbase
This is a very simple express based nodejs server.  The 
idea is to use this as a starting point for other projects.  It doesn't do anything
useful by itself.  I was just tired of plumbing the basics every time I needed
a new server project, which comes up more often than one might think. :smile:

## It utilizes:
* Typescript
* Typings (Typescript definitions for existing npm modules)
* VS Code setup for auto compile on typescript

## It demonstrates:
* Static pages
* GET controller
* POST controller
* ES6 imports and targets

## To get started:
1. Clone the project
2. CD into the repo directory
3. Run: `typings install`
4. Run: `npm install`
5. Run: `tsc`
6. To edit run: `code .`
7. To start auto-compile just compile once with: `ctrl-shift-b`
8. To run the server from the command line: `node Server.js`
9. To run from the VS Code debugger: `F5` from within VS Code

Make sure you have recent versions of all tools mentioned above
(nodejs, npm, typescript, typings and VS Code).
